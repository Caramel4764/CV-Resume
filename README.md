# Description
This is a project from The Odin Project React course. The ultimate goal was to create a resume builder thingy

Here's a few sets of goal I'd like to additional accomplish for this project
* 🎨 Somewhat beautiful styling that does not resemble a pack of crayon melting together inside a microwave
* 📷 A way to add an image/profile
* ⚡Resume should update as the user types
* 💻 Some screen size adjustment for different computer screens (not planning to make this mobile friendly)
* 💬 Make the responsibility list take value with comma separated value
* 📜 Make scollbar separate for resume and inputs so it's easier and nicer.
* 🐝 Make this bee-themed. This is probably not super professional and no resume builder (to my knowledge) does this but since this was suppose to be a fun project, why the heck not? The colors I randomly got from a color pallete generation had 80% bee colors already and I think it'd be cute.
